#TODO
- rails make migration for total game stats (total games by day)
- add the OnHoverBundles back into the main menu
- handle '-1' as unique user id on rails side (never store user data, is a temporary user)
- game config should be sent independent of game round
today
 - Set up react router to handle shift to game
 - Finish the calls to rails from react
 - Finish everything ui outside of the game in progress itself (including end game splash screen)
result as if you invested and made no sell/buys after that at start
